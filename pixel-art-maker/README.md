## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

1. First in design.js define variables required to build the grid like grid_height, grid_width, row and also table in which these row and column are appended or added.

2. Define a makeGrid function to build the grid to be called when we click on submit button for taking the number of rows and columns required.

3. Define a click function which finds each column or cells in the table and set a color to this element using .attr() attribute.
